        The Revolution.
        <br>
        Here at A&K™ Studios, our goal is to implement the new technology that has to deal with NFTs in our state. We wanted to create an ambient that is super easy to use and super responsive. Imagine buying a piece of digital artwork on the Internet at a reasonable price and getting a unique digital token known which proves your authority over the artwork you bought. Wouldn't it be great? Well, that opportunity exists now, thanks to NFTs.
        <br>
        An NFT is a digital asset that can come in the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and more. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.

        Although they’ve been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining notoriety now because they are becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork. The market for NFTs was worth a staggering $41 billion in 2021 alone, an amount that is approaching the total value of the entire global fine art market.
        
        NFTs are also generally one of a kind, or at least one of a very limited run, and have unique identifying codes. “Essentially, NFTs create digital scarcity,” says Arry Yu, chair of the Washington Technology Industry Association Cascadia Blockchain Council and managing director of Yellow Umbrella Ventures.
        
        This stands in stark contrast to most digital creations, which are almost always infinite in supply. Hypothetically, cutting off the supply should raise the value of a given asset, assuming it’s in demand.        <br>
        An exciting space is a state where we can always pursue the essence, go beyond the imagination, and pursue a design that only we can do. In addition to the display, graphics, and the way the colors are presented, and even more precisely, the angle of the staff's bows, should be taken into consideration. 
        <br>
        Then, it becomes a space that not only assimilates with the services provided by clients, but also evolves. Such a space will surely remain in people's memories, and it will become an episode that will be passed down from person to person.
        <br>
        But many NFTs, at least in these early days, have been digital creations that already exist in some form elsewhere, like iconic video clips from NBA games or securitized versions of digital art that’s already floating around on Instagram.

        Famous digital artist Mike Winklemann, better known as “Beeple,” crafted a composite of 5,000 daily drawings to create perhaps the most famous NFT of 2021, “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days,” which sold at Christie’s for a record-breaking $69.3 million.
        
        Anyone can view the individual images—or even the entire collage of images online for free. So why are people willing to spend millions on something they could easily screenshot or download?
        
        Because an NFT allows the buyer to own the original item. Not only that, it contains built-in authentication, which serves as proof of ownership. Collectors value those “digital bragging rights” almost more than the item itself.
        <br>
        Please take your time. First of all, we will deliver 100 items according to the delivery date, budget, and preference. But we aim even higher. Please ask yourself what you can do and what you should do for the space that evolves your service. At times, we may offer opinions that make people wonder, "How can a design company go that far?"
        <br>
        We look forward to hearing from you.
